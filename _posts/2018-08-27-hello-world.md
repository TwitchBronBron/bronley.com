Hello world. Yeah, I had to say it ([it's a comp-sci thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)). 

I finally started a blog! There are many things that I have considered writing blog posts about in the past, 
but I just never got around to actually doing it. This was mainly due to a lack of motivation to set up the project, figure out the web hosting situation, etc. Big shout-out to [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) for making all of this so much easier!

A little about me. Halfway through college I switched majors from Social Work to Computer Science, and I haven't looked back since. I'm passionate about coding, and enjoy programming as much on my own time as I do for my career. I currently work as a software developer for a consulting firm near Harrisburg. Get in touch if you want to find out more about what I do there.

In my free time, I like to code on side projects, play FPS games on my Xbox One, strum on my Taylor guitar, and hang out with my wife and son. I don't expect to write blog posts regularly, but as I come across something I feel is worth documenting, I'll try to pull together a post. 

Thanks for checking out my blog, and I hope you enjoy!
